    <h2>Exercise: Electromechanical Oscillation</h2>

    <p><b>Note: this is a new exercise, please  provide feedback on errors and clarity.</b></p>

    <h4>Objective</h4>

    <p>Design and test a mechanical oscillator pumped via electrical actuation.</p>

    <h4>Overview</h4>

    <p>Physical oscillators are at the core of many machines: clocks, timers,
      motors, pumps, quartz crystals, washing cycles, musical instruments, and
      on and on.  Oscillations are a product of a physical process which cycles
      through a set of states, with physical dynamics that determine the rate of
      the process.  Practical oscillators lose energy over time to friction and
      need a source of power which delivers energy in phase to maintain the
      oscillation energy.</p>

    <p>A few examples follow:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>A pendulum clock has a well-defined time constant based on the
	gravitational constant, the length of the pendulum, and (weakly) the
	magnitude of the motion.  Energy is added via an <i>escapement</i>
	mechanism which applies force <i>in phase</i> with the pendulum swing.
	The force is provided from a descending weight which stores
	gravitational potential energy.</li>

      <li>An electric motor has a <i>rotor</i> and <i>stator</i> with varying
	magnetic fields which repel each other, precisely timed to apply torque
	in phase with the rotation.  In a small DC motor, the stator holds
	permanent magnets and the rotor has an electromagnet winding with
	current controlled by <i>commutation brushes</i> which mechanically
	switch the current direction as a function of angle.  The motor lacks
	the single-frequency resonance of the pendulum; the rotational rate
	emerge as a function of the voltage, applied load, friction, and the
	intrinsic parameters.</li>

    </ol>

    <h4>Exercise Details</h4>

    <p>Creating and controlling a mechanical oscillation involves creating a
      device which incorporates a physical dynamic process and adding actuation
      to provide energy at the right time.  The following exercise is framed in
      abstract terms to allow for many possible outcomes.  But keep in mind that
      this can be very simple: a simple pendulum activated by solenoid or motor
      is perfectly fine.  And try to build as little as possible: a pendulum
      device might comprise simply a solenoid and switch taped to a board and
      wired together to a power supply to make a 'kicker', with a pendulum
      formed by a weight on the end of a string.</p>

    <h4>Steps and observations</h4>

    <ol>
      <li>Choose a mechanical process which either cycles periodically or can be
	actuated to reset to an initial condition.  Some ideas: swinging
	pendulum, 2D pendulum, ball rolling down track, mass rotating on a
	torsion spring, ball bouncing on plate, ball descending through liquid,
	water flowing between reservoirs.</li>

      <li>Choose a relevant intermittent actuation which can add energy to the
	process. Some ideas: a solenoid kicker, a winch or arm to reset object
	position, pumps.</li>

      <li>Choose a relevant state-based condition under which to activate the
	actuation.  Some ideas: a particular object position, change of center
	of mass, liquid level.  The key is that it is <i>not</i> based on time
	so that the natural time constant of the mechanical process will govern
	the oscillation rate.</li>

      <li>Design and construct a simple mechanism to implement the oscillator.
	Basic electronics are preferred but microcontrollers are permissible as
	long as they are not serving as a time reference.</li>

      <li>Test your mechanism.  What is the frequency? Is it stable? Is is
	adjustable?  How slow or fast can it go?  Can it be dynamically
	modulated?</li>
    </ol>
